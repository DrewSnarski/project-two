    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Drew Snarski and I am a 21 year old student at IIT studying ITM. I started at the University of Dayton, in Dayton Ohio, studying Computer Engineering. I didnt enjoy Dayton, so I took some time at Harper college and re-evaluated what I wanted to major in. I decided that I did not care much for actually making software, but managing them, so I switched to ITM instead.
        I have been interested in computers for really as long as I remember, but I really discovered I had a passion for them in high school. I have never built my own computer, but I did enough upgrades on a pre-built one I bought to essentially say I built it myself.
        Currently, I work at Chalet Nursery in Wilmette, working in marketing and e-commerce.

        <p>I also have a dog named Zoey. She is a English Sheepdog Poodle mix and is 1.5 years old. She is definately very puppy.
